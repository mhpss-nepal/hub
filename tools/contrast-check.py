MHPSS Nepal -- the contrast gate
---------------------------------------------------------------------
On 16 September 2026 a sweep over every text element on every page, in
light and dark, found 109 that did not clear WCAG AA. Most were one of
three token mistakes repeated everywhere:

  · --muted was #8497A2, which is 3.03:1 on white, so every caption,
    table header and eyebrow set in it failed
  · design.css forced a white body over page.css and hub.css, whose dark
    modes still coloured their own text light -- so the hub and the
    reference pages rendered near-white text on white
  · a brand blue that carries text on white (#006996) was used as a FILL
    under white text, where it is 2.97:1, and the reverse

All three are token-level, so they are checkable without a browser: read
the declared tokens out of each stylesheet's :root blocks, pair each with
the surface of its own block, and compute. That is what this does, and it
runs in the deploy guard.

It does NOT replace looking at the pages. A cascade can still land a
passing colour on an unexpected background, and only a real browser sees
that; the DOM sweep lives beside this file as contrast-sweep.py and is
run before a deploy from a machine that has Playwright.
